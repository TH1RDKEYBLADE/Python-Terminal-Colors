# Python-Terminal-Colors
This color.py file gives you easy access to using colors and styles within the terminal.

I made this file, for easy access to add colors within their terminal as long as they have knowledge of how the color implementation works with it.
It is just simply a bunch of CONSTANTS inside of a color.py file, so all you need to do. Is import the file (from color import *) and you can simply
type out the constants which with f-strings, make your color code easier to read :)
